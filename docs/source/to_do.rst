To Do and Issues
================

To Do:

- Nested complex argument type safety. Recursively check attributes, not methods?
- Handle mocking of functions (not methods)
- Handle mocking of args, kwargs method signatures.
- More control of type safety strictness through config. Not just an enum.
- Helpers for mockng of static members? class methods, module variables etc...


Issues:

- Nothing here yet, but I am sure there will be soon.
